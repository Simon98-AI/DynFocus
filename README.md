- **Dynamic Event Prototype Estimation (DPE)**: DPE serves as the dynamic selector to accurately discern the meaningful frames, which takes both
 redundancy and correspondence to question answering into consideration as the selection standard. 
- **Compact Cooperative Encoding (CCE)**: Afterwards, CCE complies with the dynamic encoding principle. The meaningful frames are encoded with fine-grained context features for detailed visual appearance, whereas those redundant frames are substantially encapsulated into a few tokens for sketchy perception, which enables LLM to capture broader temporal clues within a fixed receptive field.
